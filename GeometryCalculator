                    **C++ CODE**
-----------------------------------------------------
This is the code that I wrote for Program #23 on page
225 of Chapter 4 'Making Decisions'. If I were you, 
please open the README file to see more details. Here
is the question itself though so if came here from 
Google, this is why...lol.
-----------------------------------------------------
Write a program that displays the following menu:
Geometry Calculator
1. Calculate the Area of a Circle
2. Calculate the Area of a Rectangle
3. Calculate the Area of a Triangle
4. Quit
Enter your choice (1-4):
If the user enters 1, the program should ask for the radius of the circle and then display
its area. Use the following formula:
area  π r
2
Use 3.14159 for π and the radius of the circle for r. If the user enters 2, the program
should ask for the length and width of the rectangle and then display the rectangle’s
area. Use the following formula:
area = length * width
If the user enters 3 the program should ask for the length of the triangle’s base and its
height, and then display its area. Use the following formula:
area = base * height * .5
If the user enters 4, the program should end.
Input Validation: Display an error message if the user enters a number outside the range
of 1 through 4 when selecting an item from the menu. Do not accept negative values
for the circle’s radius, the rectangle’s length or width, or the triangle’s base or height.
-----------------------------------------------------
Anyways, here's the code below....and I'm gonna say
this again just to make sure you understand: Open the
README file for more details. But....yeah. Hope this
helps you with your code! :)
